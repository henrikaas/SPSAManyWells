# ManyWells: simulation of multi-phase flow in vertical oil and gas wells

This code implements a steady-state drift-flux model for simulating two-phase (liquid and gas) flow in wells.
Three-phase flow (gas, oil, water) is supported by treating the oil and water as one mixed liquid phase.
Wells are modelled from the bottomhole pressure to the downstream choke pressure. 
Boundary conditions are introduced via an inflow model (bottomhole) and a choke model (topside).

The simulator has several use cases:
- Generate semi-realistic well production data
- Flow prediction by calibrating the model parameters to historical data
- Investigate sensitivities of variables of interest
